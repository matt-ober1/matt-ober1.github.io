            <p>
            <b>Hi! I am currently a junior at West Virginia University majoring in cybersecurity and actively working towards obtaining the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate. My coursework has equipped me with a solid foundation in cybersecurity principles, including network security, cryptography, and incident response. This knowledge is complemented by hands-on experience gained through lab exercises and practical projects, which have sharpened my ability to analyze and mitigate security threats effectively. While it may not be required for the Google Course, I am using this website as a way to challenge myself as web application development is something that I have struggled with. Feel free to stick along for this journey I'm happy you are here!</b>
